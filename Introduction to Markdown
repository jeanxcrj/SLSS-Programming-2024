**Hello** _world_.

This is **_markdown_**.

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) is a really useful tool. I also use [Google](https://google.com/) to find this

# Table in Markdown

To make a list we can use the following:

* This is item one
* This is item two 
    * this is a subpoint in the list 


- This is another list
- We can use dashes instead of *s

1. This is item one 
2. This is item two 
    - This is a _subpoint_ under two 
3. This is item _three_
    * **hello**


# Blockquote

These are usually used to show quote, things that someone has said 

It's useful to give emphasis to a collection of lines
